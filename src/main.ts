// The app drives two surfaces from one bundle: the glasses (a single full-screen
// text container over BLE) and a companion browser panel. It talks to an on-box
// bridge (server/rc_bridge.py) that wraps claude-rc-api and only ever exposes
// active, connected sessions — never archived or dead ones.
//
// Boot tolerates the absence of the Even App bridge (a plain browser / the
// headless browser-test harness): it falls back to "panel-only" mode, where the
// session list, live stream, sending, and steering all still work through the
// panel — just without the glasses display, gestures, or mic.
