# CLAUDE.md — Claude Remote

Steer active Claude Code Remote Control sessions from Even Realities G2 glasses
(576×288 BLE HUD + touchpad + mic), with a companion phone panel. `README.md`
has the architecture, controls, and project layout; this file is the operating
notes and sharp edges.

Ship model: the client is distributed as a prebuilt `.ehpk`; the bridge runs on
any host logged in to Claude Code. Builds carry NO configuration at all — every
pack is a distribution pack — so the panel's Settings card (runtime settings in
localStorage) is the end-user config path, and no secret may ever be required
at build time.

## Rules

1. **The bridge adds no Anthropic code.** It reuses `claude-rc-api`'s
   `RemoteControlClient` (checked out at `../claude-rc-api`) and layers on only
   the active+connected filter, a bearer/CORS guard, and the `control_response`
   builders for the two blocking flavors. Session control, streaming, and OAuth
   (including rotated-token reload) live in `claude-rc-api` — don't reimplement
   or add credential logic here.
2. **Only-active, always.** Surface and steer only sessions that are `active`
   **and** `connected`. The bridge filters server-side and every control action
   re-checks; a `409` (`BridgeError.isInactive`) means "gone" → toast + back to
   the list. Never act on an inactive session.
3. **Lean on the firmware — don't fight it.** The HUD uses the SDK's *native*
   widgets (`glasses.ts`), modeled on the `nickustinov/demo-app-g2` reference
   app. Never `rebuildPageContainer` while a body is being scrolled — it resets
   the native scroll position. Steady-state changes are per-container
   `textContainerUpgrade`s (header / body / footer diffed independently); a full
   rebuild only when the layout kind or a native list's items change.
4. **Effort is a fallback control.** Remote-control workers (through at least
   2.1.212) REFUSE the `apply_flag_settings` control that carries `effortLevel`
   ("REPL bridge does not handle…" — confirmed live), so claude-rc-api's
   `set_effort(wait=…, command_fallback=True)` waits for the worker's verdict
   and falls back to injecting the `/effort <level>` slash command, which RC
   workers DO execute as a zero-cost local command (also confirmed live; slash
   commands sent as user messages run locally in general). Mind the semantics:
   the command path **persists that machine's default effort** for new sessions
   (CLI behavior), it is not session-scoped; the bridge's response `via` field
   says which path ran. No upstream field exposes the current effort — the
   glasses mark only the last level applied from this app (`effortBySid`).

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # app dev server → 0.0.0.0:5175
npm run bridge       # bridge → 0.0.0.0:8790 (config from .env.local)
npm run bridge:uv    # bridge through ../claude-rc-api's uv env (sibling checkout)
npm run pack         # env-free build + version check → claude-remote-<version>.ehpk
npx @evenrealities/evenhub-cli qr --url http://<host>:5175   # sideload QR
```

- **Bump `version` in both `package.json` and `app.json`** (kept identical) on
  every code/manifest change — `pack` stamps it into the artifact name, and
  `scripts/check-versions.mjs` fails the pack if the two drift.
- **Every pack is a distribution pack.** `pack` packs the tracked `app.json`
  verbatim, and the build resolves NO `VITE_*` vars (`envPrefix` is swapped to a
  never-matching prefix for `vite build` — see vite.config.ts), so `.env.local`
  never enters an artifact: no keys, no tokens, no personal hosts. There is no
  personal-pack flavor; `VITE_*` vars affect `npm run dev` only. Connectivity
  therefore rides `app.json`'s `"*"` network-whitelist entry (whether phones
  honor the wildcard is unverified on hardware — there is no per-host whitelist
  folding anymore).
- **The simulator runs headlessly.** `@evenrealities/sim-linux-x64` is a
  GTK/WebKit binary: run under `xvfb-run` (on NixOS, put its libs on
  `NIX_LD_LIBRARY_PATH` via nix-ld) with `--automation-port 9898`, then drive it
  over HTTP: `GET /api/screenshot/glasses` (the exact 576×288 framebuffer),
  `POST /api/input {"action":"up|down|click|double_click"}`, `GET /api/console`.
  Relaunch after every edit — Vite HMR does NOT reload the entry module. The sim
  caps text containers at 999 bytes. Real hardware is still needed for the mic
  and true native scroll.
- **No Even bridge (plain browser) = panel-only mode** — glasses/gesture/mic
  paths skip; the session list, stream, and steering still work via the panel.

## HUD gotchas

- **The firmware font has NO emoji and NO dingbats** (`✓ ✗ ⚠ ⚙ … › •` render as
  nothing). Every HUD glyph must come from the `HUD` set in `glasses.ts`
  (`● ○ ! ◆ ◇ ☉ » ▶ ■ ← ·`). Ground truth: `nickustinov/even-g2-notes`
  (`docs/display.md`). **`ui.ts` is exempt** — the panel is a real browser
  WebView; rich glyphs there are intended, and it formats events itself
  (independently of the HUD-only `events/format.ts`). Don't "fix" it.
- **Native text scroll is boundary-only.** A text container with
  `isEventCapture:1` is scrolled smoothly by the firmware; the app only sees
  `SCROLL_TOP`/`SCROLL_BOTTOM` at the ends. The session view exploits this: an
  auto-following **live** tail + frozen multi-screen **history** windows
  (`EventLog.tailWindow/windowBefore/windowFrom`). Do not reintroduce software
  page-flipping.
- **The firmware renders text TOP-aligned and never auto-scrolls**, so an
  overflowing live tail hides exactly the newest lines. The tail
  (`EventLog.tailRows`) is budgeted by estimated visual ROWS (`LIVE_BODY_ROWS` ×
  `HUD_CHARS_PER_ROW`, wrapping counted) so it always fits — a byte budget alone
  can't guarantee that. Every session opens on this tail (`● live` running /
  `○ latest` idle); scroll-up enters history.
- **Consecutive tool_uses COLLAPSE into chain lines — never one line each.**
  Measured on live sessions: ~6 tool calls per line of assistant prose, in runs
  of up to 27, and one verbose `◆ Name  <input>` line each (a long path or shell
  command) wrapped to 4 of the 6 live rows, so the HUD showed two tool calls and
  none of the narration. Now `format.ts` squeezes each tool to a `Name arg`
  ENTRY (`toolChainEntry`) and packs a run into one-row `◆ a, b, c` lines
  (`packToolChain`), folding consecutive identical entries to `entry xN`. Two
  rules keep it working: only CRISP args earn the slot (a command's program, a
  path's basename, a pattern, a URL host — never `description`/`prompt`/`query`,
  which blow the width AND, differing every call, defeat the `xN` fold); and
  `EventLog` owns the run, because `renderEventParts` is per-event and can't see
  neighbours. **An event that renders to nothing must NOT break the chain** — a
  `tool_result` echo lands between every pair of tool_uses, so breaking on it
  makes every chain exactly one tool long. Only real content (prose, a result, a
  prompt) closes it. The chain re-packs its block IN PLACE on each new tool, and
  only ever rewrites tail lines so frozen history-window indices stay valid.
- **Content caps are BYTES, not chars** (~1000 per rebuild, ~2000 per upgrade,
  999 in the simulator; native lists: 20 rows, ~63 bytes per item), and HUD
  glyphs are 2–3 bytes each — an oversize container is **silently dropped** (the
  screen just freezes). `glasses.ts` byte-clamps every body (`BODY_BYTE_CAP`)
  and list item (`MAX_ITEM_BYTES`); the log packs windows by bytes
  (`LIVE_BODY_BYTES` / `HISTORY_WINDOW_BYTES`). Never size anything by chars.
- **A failed/hung write must invalidate the display mirror.** `glasses.ts`
  commits its per-container "what's on screen" state only when the SDK call
  returns `true`, races every call against a timeout (a BLE call that never
  settles would wedge the serialized pump and freeze the HUD for good), and on
  any failure forgets the page so the next render repaints from scratch. Don't
  "optimize" the mirror updates back to unconditional.
- **A list rebuild resets the firmware highlight to row 0 — resync or misfire.**
  The app's `listSelectIndex` mirrors the firmware's highlight, but taps on row
  0 arrive with `currentSelectItemIndex` protobuf-dropped, so a stale index
  fires the WRONG row (opens the wrong session, wrong menu action, Deny instead
  of Allow). `GlassesDisplay.onListRebuild` fires after every full list build and
  main.ts resets the index there; when a tap carries no index, the row is
  resolved from `currentSelectItemName` against `GlassesDisplay.listItems`. Keep
  both paths when touching list code — this bug class was reproduced live
  (tapping "Dictate" opened the Commands submenu).
- **The session list is sorted by title, client-side.** The bridge orders by
  recent activity, which churns every poll — each reorder is a rebuild that
  yanks the highlight to the top and re-routes the next tap. Don't surface the
  bridge's order on a native list.
- **Exactly one `isEventCapture:1` container per page** (the scroll/tap target).
- **Root-page exit MUST be `shutDownPageContainer(1)`** (the system exit-confirm
  dialog) — Even Hub review REJECTS a mode-0 immediate exit on the root page
  (rejection received 2026-07-22; see hub.evenrealities.com/docs/ship/app-submission,
  which also floors `min_sdk_version` at 0.0.12). Because the user can cancel
  that dialog, `exit()` must NOT tear anything down — cleanup belongs to
  `SYSTEM_EXIT_EVENT` / `beforeunload` only. The simulator doesn't render the
  dialog (it just blanks the glasses page); the confirm layer is only visible
  on hardware via a beta build.
- **Gesture events are messy:** they arrive as `listEvent` OR `textEvent` OR
  `sysEvent` — coalesce all three. `CLICK_EVENT` is `0`, which protobuf drops,
  so a tap arrives as `eventType === undefined`. IMU frames are ignored.

## Blocking prompts

- **Two kinds, two screens, both native lists.** A blocking `control_request`
  is either a **tool-permission** (the `permission` screen: `[Allow, Deny]`,
  Allow=row 0; answered via `/permission` — the full tool input lives on the
  panel, the HUD shows a clip) or a **question** (the `question` screen: the
  options + a trailing `← Dismiss` row; answered via `/dialog`). On BOTH,
  double-tap **sets the prompt aside** (sends nothing — see below).
- **`AskUserQuestion` arrives as a `can_use_tool` permission** (confirmed live),
  NOT a `request_user_dialog`: its `input` carries the `questions`, and `/dialog`
  answers it on the PERMISSION path — `build_question_answer` sends an `allow`
  whose `updatedInput` echoes `questions` (the tool crashes without it) plus
  `answers`, a map keyed by **question TEXT** → chosen label (list for
  multi-select; empty map = graceful dismiss). Discriminator:
  `isQuestionRequest` in `events/format.ts`. The `{status, result}` shape
  (`build_dialog_answer`) is an UNCONFIRMED fallback for true
  `request_user_dialog` / `side_question` kinds — verify against a live sample
  before trusting it.
- **Prompts QUEUE; they never hijack.** Three guards against stale/replayed
  requests: the bridge fetches history `desc` (newest events) so the stream
  resume cursor is never ancient; `EventLog.append` seq-dedupe gates all UI
  side-effects; prompts live in a FIFO (`prompts[]` + `answeredIds`) and retire
  on a matching `control_response` in the stream (our own answers echo back),
  on the turn's `result`, or via the poll safety-net when the session leaves
  `requires_action`. **An assistant event after a `control_request` does NOT
  mean it was answered.** A prompt presents immediately only while passively
  watching the live tail; otherwise it defers (footer `! needs you`) and shows
  on return to the session view. A blocked session opens straight onto its
  prompt (`findPendingControl` + `workerStatus === 'requires_action'`).
- **Set-aside = a STICKY defer (`promptSnoozed`).** Double-tap calls
  `snoozePrompt()`: marks the prompt `promptDeferred + promptSnoozed` and drops
  to the live tail without answering. The snooze flag is the one difference
  from a normal defer — the auto-present guards in `go('session')` and
  `enterLive()` skip snoozed prompts, so returning to live won't reopen it. It
  reopens only deliberately: the Compose menu's leading `! Answer question` /
  `! Review permission` row, or reopening the session. It clears on
  `presentPrompt`/`armPrompt`/`clearPromptState`, and the prompt still retires
  normally while set aside. Because the Compose list varies with pending state,
  it is snapshotted into `composeItems` on entry so a mid-menu stream event
  can't desync the firmware row → action map.

## Send confirmation

- **A message never fires on one tap.** Both a canned quick-send (Compose) and a
  finished dictation route through the `confirm` screen (`confirmSend` →
  `pendingSend` → `commitPendingSend`/`cancelPendingSend`), so a stray touchpad
  tap can't send the wrong thing. It's the same native `scroll` layout as the
  voice screen — full message in the natively-scrolled body, `tap = send`,
  `dbl = cancel` — so a long dictation can be read back before it goes.
- **Glasses-only guard.** The panel's quick-send / Dictate controls are explicit
  buttons (not misclick-prone), so they still send directly via `commitVoice` /
  `onSend`; don't add a panel confirm. The voice screen's tap now **reviews**
  (`reviewDictation`, footer `tap = done`), it no longer sends — `commitVoice`
  survives only for the panel's Stop button.
- **Cancel returns to `pendingSend.back`:** the Compose menu for a canned send
  (so re-pick is one tap; `listSelectIndex` is reset to match the rebuilt list),
  the live session for a dictation (its mic is already closed). `backToList`
  clears `pendingSend`; a deferred prompt still can't hijack the confirm screen
  (it's not `session`+`live`, so `armPrompt` defers).

## Slash commands

- **They ride `/send` — no bridge route.** A slash command is just a `/name`
  message; RC workers execute it locally at zero cost (the same mechanism the
  effort control's fallback uses — see rule 4). The Compose → Commands submenu
  (`commandItems`, `fireSlashCommand`) and the panel's `/` autocomplete both go
  through the existing `send`/`onSend` path. Adding a command is a `SLASH_COMMANDS`
  config entry (`VITE_SLASH_COMMANDS` overrides it in dev), never new bridge code.
- **Curate to fire-and-observe commands only, and VALIDATE live.** Not every
  command works over remote-control, and the failure modes are silent-ish:
  - **Refused by the worker** — some print `"/<name> isn't available over Remote
    Control."` as an assistant line and do nothing. Confirmed live (2026-07-17,
    Haiku RC worker): `/status` and `/release-notes` both refuse this way. Keep
    them out.
  - **Not a real local command** — an unrecognized `/name` is NOT echoed as a
    local command; it falls through to the model as a literal user message and
    triggers a full (tool-using) turn. Confirmed: `/todos` did exactly this
    (assistant → ToolSearch → TaskList). This is the worst case — it spends a
    model turn — so never ship an unverified name.
  - **Aliases** — `/cost` redirects to `/usage` (the echo shows
    `<command-name>/usage`), so ship the canonical name.
  - **Verified good** (local, `$0`, glanceable output): `/context`, `/usage`,
    `/mcp`, `/compact`. `/clear` runs (no error, no model turn) but emits NO
    `<local-command-stdout>`, so it gives no HUD feedback that it worked.
  - Interactive ones (`/login`, `/config`, `/vim`, `/ide`, `/terminal-setup`)
    have no remote meaning. Mind machine-global semantics too: like `/effort`,
    some commands persist a machine default rather than being session-scoped.
  - Test harness: send `/name` via `POST /api/sessions/<sid>/send`, then read
    `/events` — a good command shows the `<command-name>` + `<local-command-stdout>`
    echo with zero `result.usage.costUsd` and no assistant turn.
- **`confirm:true` = don't fire on one interaction** (heavy/destructive, e.g.
  `/compact`, `/clear`). On the glasses it routes through the send-confirm screen;
  on the panel it fills the box and waits for an explicit Send. `takesArg:true`
  makes the panel fill `/name ` and wait for a typed argument (glasses fire bare
  — v1 has no on-glasses argument entry; dictated args are a planned fast-follow).
- **Command echoes are cleaned on BOTH surfaces by `cleanUserEcho`** (exported
  from `events/format.ts`, used by the HUD's `renderEventParts` AND the panel's
  `renderEventNode`). It unwraps `<command-name>` / `<command-args>` /
  `<local-command-stdout>` to readable text and DROPS the `<local-command-caveat>`
  block (that block is addressed to the model — "DO NOT respond to these
  messages…" — so it's noise for the reader; a caveat-only event cleans to '' and
  is dropped). Confirmed live in the simulator: without this the panel showed raw
  `<command-name>/context</command-name>` + the caveat paragraph as message
  bubbles. Note a local command still yields two user events that both read as the
  command (the send + the `<command-name>` echo); the HUD's row-budgeted tail
  usually hides the older one, the panel shows both — acceptable, not deduped.

## Config & secrets

- **Layering, runtime wins:** panel-saved settings (`claude-remote.settings` in
  localStorage) → `VITE_*` from `.env.local` (DEV SERVER ONLY — builds resolve
  no env, so on a packed build this layer is empty) → defaults. When debugging
  "why THAT bridge/token", check localStorage before the env. Never make a
  `VITE_` value required at build time — packs must work with none set.
- **Panel settings persist via the SDK, not browser storage.** The Settings card
  saves to the WebView's `window.localStorage`, but the Even app EVICTS that
  between launches — so `main.ts` mirrors the same `claude-remote.settings` JSON
  into the SDK's App-side store (`bridge.set/getLocalStorage`, which persists
  natively). `hydrateSettings()` seeds the browser cache from it at boot, BEFORE
  the first connect, so a reopened app reconnects itself; `persistSettings()`
  writes it back on every save. Both are `withTimeout`-guarded (a slow/absent
  native method can't stall boot) and no-op with no Even bridge (a plain browser
  persists localStorage on its own). Without this the wearer re-enters the bridge
  URL + token on every reopen.
- **The bridge reads `.env.local` too** (`RC_BRIDGE_*` keys; `VITE_BRIDGE_TOKEN`
  doubles as the token; CLI flags and process env win). With no token configured
  it GENERATES a word passphrase (`RC_BRIDGE_TOKEN_WORDS` words from
  `wordlist.py`, default 5 ≈ 52 bits) and persists it to
  `~/.config/claude-remote/bridge-token`; `--open` is the only unauthenticated
  mode. A user-set token is used verbatim.
- **Deepgram key** lives in `.env.local` or the Settings card; voice
  auto-disables when blank.
- `server/pyproject.toml` depends on `claude-rc-api` by DIRECT GIT URL — needed
  for the `uvx --from git+…` install path; PyPI would reject it (see
  `server/README.md`).

## Repo

- **PUBLIC** — origin is `github.com/ThatCrispyToast/g2-claude-remote`.
  Everything committed is world-readable: never commit tokens, tailnet
  hostnames/IPs, or personal paths (`.env.local` / `*.ehpk` / `*.log` are
  gitignored for exactly that reason).
- The local-only `backup/pre-publish-history` branch holds the pre-squash
  history and must NEVER be pushed; the old private `rc-g2` GitHub repo stays
  private. No auto-push — commit + push manually when asked.
