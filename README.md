# Claude Remote

Steer live [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code)
remote-control sessions from [Even Realities G2](https://www.evenrealities.com)
glasses: the event stream on the HUD, the touchpad to approve and reply, the mic
to dictate. A companion phone panel mirrors it all with a fuller control surface.

## Quick start

1. **Install the app** on your glasses from the
   [Even Hub](https://evenhub.evenrealities.com/landing?package_id=com.thatcrispytoast.clauderemote),
   or sideload a packed `claude-remote-<version>.ehpk`.

2. **Run the bridge** on the machine where you're logged in to Claude Code (needs
   [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)) or an analagous python manager:

   ```bash
   uvx --from "git+https://github.com/ThatCrispyToast/g2-claude-remote#subdirectory=server" claude-remote-bridge
   ```

   It prints the URLs your phone can reach it at and a bearer token: a word
   passphrase like `coral-anvil-mango-scoop-visor`, generated on first run and
   saved to `~/.config/claude-remote/bridge-token`.

3. **Connect** - enter one of those URLs and the token in the panel's Settings
   card. Add a [Deepgram](https://console.deepgram.com) key there for voice
   dictation; leave it blank and voice disables itself.

Can't connect? Open the bridge's port (default `8790`) in the host firewall.

> [!CAUTION]
> Keep the bridge on a private network i.e. LAN or Tailscale. The token is the only guard, and it can read and steer every remote-control session of the logged-in account. Flags and env vars: [`server/README.md`](server/README.md).

## What it does

- **Live sessions on the HUD** - each opens on its newest output and auto-follows
  while running. Scroll up to page through history, down to re-attach to the tail.
  Runs of tool calls collapse into one compact line (`◆ Read factory.py, Edit
  scene.yaml`) so what Claude is actually saying stays readable.
- **Answer blocking prompts** - permission requests and questions arrive as native
  screens (right away if you're watching, `! needs you` in the footer if not).
  Tap to answer, double-tap to set aside. Answer one elsewhere and it retires itself.
- **Steer hands-free** - interrupt, switch model / permission mode / reasoning
  effort, fire slash commands (`/context`, `/usage`, `/compact`, …), send canned
  replies, or dictate by voice.
- **Active sessions only** - archived and dead ones never reach the glasses, and
  every control action re-checks before it acts.

## How it works

```
G2 glasses (576×288 HUD · touchpad · mic)
        │ BLE
        ▼
Even phone app - runs this app (glasses UI + companion panel)
        │ HTTP + SSE · bearer token · LAN / Tailscale
        ▼
claude-remote-bridge (server/) - wraps claude-rc-api
        │ your Claude Code OAuth login (~/.claude)
        ▼
Anthropic Remote Control API
```

The app (`src/`, packed into an `.ehpk`) runs inside the Even phone app and draws
on the glasses through the firmware's native widgets. The bridge
([`server/`](server/README.md)) is a small JSON+SSE server over
[`claude-rc-api`](https://github.com/ThatCrispyToast/claude-rc-api). It runs on
any machine logged in to Claude Code, borrows that login (surviving token
rotation), and adds the active-only filter, bearer-token auth, and the routes for
answering blocking prompts.

## Controls

| Screen | Scroll ↑ / ↓ | Tap | Double-tap |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sessions list** | move selection | open session | exit dialog |
| **Session view** | native scroll - up into history, down to live | open Compose menu | back to list |
| **Compose menu** | move selection | fire action / enter submenu | back to session |
| **Commands submenu** | move selection | fire slash command | back to Compose |
| **Model / Mode / Effort submenu** | move selection | apply | back to Compose |
| **Voice dictation** | scroll transcript | done - review before sending | cancel |
| **Confirm send** | scroll the message | send | cancel |
| **Permission prompt** | move between Allow / Deny | pick | set aside |
| **Question** | move between options | pick (`Dismiss` cancels) | set aside |

The Compose menu leads with Dictate, then the quick-sends (`Proceed`, `Run tests`,
`Explain` - configurable), `Interrupt`, `Commands`, `Model`, `Mode`, `Effort`, and
`Archive`. Slash commands run locally at no token cost; heavy ones (`/compact`,
`/clear`) go through the confirm screen first. A set-aside prompt reopens from the
Compose menu's `! Answer question` / `! Review permission` row, or by reopening the
session. No blocking screen can trap you.

## The companion panel

The same bundle's DOM is a full control surface in the phone's WebView: the
un-clipped event log with tool inputs and usage/cost, free-text sends with `/`
slash-command autocomplete, every steering control, and the Settings card. It
still works as a plain-browser web app with no glasses connected.

App updates can also carry a **release notice** — a slim dismissible card above
the session list for anything important (say, "update your bridge"). Notices are
baked into the build (nothing is fetched), and each one shows until dismissed,
then never again on that device. On the glasses the same notice appears once as
a scrollable screen right after connect — tap acknowledges it, double-tap defers
it to the next launch — and acknowledging on either surface retires it on both.

## Configuration

Two layers on the app side; the higher wins.

1. **Runtime settings** - the panel's Settings card (bridge URL, token, Deepgram
   key), stored on the device across app restarts. This is how a packed `.ehpk` is
   configured.
2. **Dev-server defaults** - `VITE_*` vars in `.env.local`, read by `npm run dev`
   only ([`.env.example`](.env.example) lists them all). Packs never include them:
   `npm run pack` builds with env resolution disabled, so no key or host can leak
   into an artifact.

The bridge takes CLI flags and `RC_BRIDGE_*` env vars, and reads `.env.local` too
(`VITE_BRIDGE_TOKEN` doubles as its token), so one file configures both sides in
development.

## Development

Node 18+ for the app; Python 3.10+ with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for the
bridge.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ThatCrispyToast/g2-claude-remote && cd g2-claude-remote
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local     # set VITE_BRIDGE_URL / VITE_BRIDGE_TOKEN

npm run bridge                 # bridge → 0.0.0.0:8790
npm run dev                    # app dev server → http://0.0.0.0:5175

# sideload onto the glasses (phone on the same Wi-Fi / Tailscale network)
npx @evenrealities/evenhub-cli qr --url http://<host>:5175 --external
```

Point `VITE_BRIDGE_URL` at an address the phone can reach - a Tailscale MagicDNS
name or a LAN IP. To hack on `claude-rc-api` at the same time, clone it next to
this repo and use `npm run bridge:uv`.

**Packaging:** `npm run pack` builds and packs `claude-remote-<version>.ehpk`.
Every pack is distributable (no env is resolved), and it refuses to run if
`package.json` and `app.json` disagree on the version - bump both together.

**Bridge as a service:** the bridge holds no state, so any service manager works.
Install it once and point a systemd unit (or equivalent) at `claude-remote-bridge`:

```bash
uv tool install "git+https://github.com/ThatCrispyToast/g2-claude-remote#subdirectory=server"
```
